hello I am Samuel and I'm an IB studnet stuying in Vancouver. I wouldn't call myself a software engineer cuz I just make stuff that either makes me happy or stuff that benefit my life. Btw don't expect me to post stuff on here cuz making stuff doesn't mean knowing how to put stuff on github (lol what a shit guy). Coding is just my interest so I can make some RNG heavy games to fuck myself over like getting the same support card for 6 times in a row and Im not fixing it. Im probably not going to be a software engineer when I grow up cuz I'm pretty weird with it and I either spend a lot of time on one project or don't do anything at all. I also love music and soccer, which I consider as my main hobbies, more.  Anyway wish you have a good day. Oh ya check out my stuff at https://starrrynight.github.io/personalPage/ if u don't mind. Forgot to mention I used to enjoy competetive programming.
